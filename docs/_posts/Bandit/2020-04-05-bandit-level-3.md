description: Walkthrough of Level 3 of OverTheWire Bandit

This is going to be a walkthrough of Level 3 of Bandit from OverTheWire Wargames.

We found the password from [level 2](bandit-level-2).

Username: `bandit3`  
Password: `UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK`

First we SSH into the box.

We then list the files in the home directory.

We then see a directory called `inhere`.  
Let's change the directory and list the files.

But there is nothing in this directory.
Another option that can be added to `ls` is `-a`. This option allows `ls` to read file that would be otherwise hidden.

Notice now that there are 2 directories and a file. I won't get into too much detail into what each directory means.  
But the "." directory points to the current directory. So if we were to `cd` into this directory we wouldnâ€™t move anywhere.  
The ".." directory points to the directory above the current directory. So by `cd`-ing into that directory, would move us into the previous directory.  
We can `cat` files that have a dot point in front of its name just like any file and doing so reveals the password to the next level.

This is the start of a number of posts giving a walkthrough of the OverTheWire Bandit series.

If you haven't already, I recommend trying each level first before reading this walkthrough as it gives you more of an understanding of what's going on, and you'll learn more.

We start at Bandit 0.

Username: `bandit0`  
Password: `bandit0`

Doing `ls -l` gives us a file.

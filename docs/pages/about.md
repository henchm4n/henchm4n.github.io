# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

I graduated from the University of Queensland in December 2021 with a Bachelor of Computer Science, majoring in Cyber Security.

My interests include cyber security, specifically offensive security and detecting network mis-actors, blockchain technologies and programming.

In my free time, I like to read as well as hiking, running and swimming.
